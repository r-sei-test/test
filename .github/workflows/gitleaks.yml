# Gitleaks secret scanning (native SARIF) with hardening and best practices
# =============================================================================
# What this workflow does (in order):
#   1) Checks out your repository with read-only permissions and no persisted credentials.
#   2) Runs Gitleaks (pinned to a commit SHA) to scan for hard-coded secrets.
#   3) Writes a SARIF report to the workspace root (relative path).
#   4) Uploads the SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning if the file exists.
#
# Key security & reliability patterns:
#   - Default-deny permissions at the workflow level (read-only by default).
#   - Least privilege in the job (add security-events: write only for SARIF upload).
#   - SHA-pinned third-party actions (reproducible, tamper-resistant).
#   - Concurrency to cancel superseded runs.
#   - Timeouts to cap spend and fail fast.
#   - Hardened network egress with StepSecurity.
#   - Scoped checkout credentials.
#   - Conditional upload: the SARIF uploader runs only if the file is present.
