# Dependency Review (PRs and Pushes) — hardened
# =============================================================================
# What this workflow does:
#   - On PRs that change dependency manifests: runs GitHub’s Dependency Review,
#     annotates the PR, and (optionally) provide a summary.
#   - On pushes to main (or chosen branches): compares the new commit to
#     the previous one to catch vulnerable upgrades outside PRs.
#
# Key practices:
#   - Default-deny permissions at workflow level; jobs elevate only what they need.
#   - Pin third-party actions to commit SHAs (reproducible, tamper-resistant).
#   - Guard untrusted PRs (use pull_request, not pull_request_target).
#   - Concurrency cancels superseded runs to avoid CI pile-ups.
#   - Timeouts cap spend and fail fast.
#   - Harden egress with StepSecurity.
#   - Scoped checkout credentials.
#   - Trigger only when dependency files or this workflow change.
