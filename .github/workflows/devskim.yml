# DevSkim (hardened, pinned, least-privilege) — PRs, pushes, manual, weekly
# =============================================================================
# What this workflow does (high-level):
#   - Runs DevSkim on your repository and writes a SARIF report
#   - Uploads the SARIF to GitHub’s Code Scanning (Security tab)
#
# Why these patterns (best practices recap):
#   - Default-deny permissions at the workflow level (read-only by default)
#   - Only the uploader job gets permission to write security events
#   - Every third-party action is pinned to a specific commit SHA
#   - Concurrency cancels older superseded runs (fewer pile-ups on busy PRs)
#   - Timeouts cap spend and prevent hangs
#   - Egress hardening audits outbound network calls 
#   - Checkout without persisted credentials
